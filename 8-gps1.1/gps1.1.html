          <h4 id="Red">What is pair programming?</h4>
          <p> Pair programming is two people programming together. There are three kinds of pair programming:</p>
          <div id="PairProTypes">
            <ul>
              <li>
              <h5 id="Orange">Driver-Navigator</h5>
              <p>The driver-navigator pairing structure is analogous to a road trip,
                where the driver concentrates on driving the vehicle with their hands
                on the wheel, while the navigator reads the map and tells the driver
                where to turn. For programming, one programmer is designated as the "driver",
                who will type the code and deal with syntax details, and the other as the
                "navigator", who will guide and review code as its being written. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <h5 id="Yellow">Ping Pong Pairing</h5>
              <p>Ping-pong pairing is a common pairing structure when doing test driven development (TDD).
                In TDD, one programmer writes a test for code yet to be written. The second programmer
                writes codes to make the test pass. The programmers can continue to develop by going back
                and forth, adding new tests and adding new code.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <h5 id="Green">Expert-Novice</h5>
              <p>The expert-novice pairing structure is a variation on the driver-navigator structure for
                 when one programmer is more experienced than the other. Either can be the driver or
                 navigator, but there is an emphasis on guiding the novice through the material. This is
                 beneficial to the expert, as well, because they can improve their teaching skills.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h4 id="Blue">Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h4>
          <p>
            Pair programming is important to DBC because it reflects DBC's core values of teamwork and collaboration.
            DBC aims to do more than merely teach the technical skill of web programming; it also looks to instill
            practices at working in a software team by exposing a student to diverse personalities and work styles
            while maintaining a positive attitude and productive flow of output.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4 id="Violet">Compare Driver and Navigator</h4>
          <p>
            In Driver-Navigator pair programming, the Driver is the person who physically types in code and
            moves the mouse cursor around while the Navigator is the person who tells the Driver what to type
            and where to type it. These roles aren't overly rigid; the Driver might give his input about which
            parts of the code the pair should direct their attention to, while the Navigator might occasionally
            move the mouse cursor or type in a bit of code if the Driver isn't sure where to put it.
