  <h1 class="post_title"> Thinking Styles & The Growth Mindset </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> According to the Gregorc Thinking Style quiz, I'm almost entirely split down the middle between the Abstract Sequential and Concrete Random styles. This sounds like it's the perfect description of an antisocial software engineer who hates rules and likes experimenting to find new solutions. This actually somewhat fits my struggles in Phase 0. I probably haven't paired enough times on the various challenges because I prefer to just power through them on my own at hours of the day/night when most people probably wouldn't prefer to work. As far as learning the actual curriculum though, I think I've been doing all right so far.

      I like the idea of adopting a growth mindset and it makes perfect sense. Even in a world in which intelligence might be a fixed or partially fixed trait, having a growth mindset still maximizes the functional utility of the intelligence that you possess. I would equate possession of a growth mindset with another word which is used far more often: confidence. In my opinion, a growth mindset is simply having confidence that you will be able to meet and eventually overcome any intellectual challenges you might face.
