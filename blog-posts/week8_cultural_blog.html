  <h1 class="post_title"> Dealing with Conflict </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> I perceive most conflicts as falling into one of two categories. First, there is conflict arising from a rational opposition of interests, usually over some scarce resource. These conflicts are extremely common and are in fact the basis of the price-setting mechanism in our economy. I don't mind these sorts of conflicts because they can oftentimes be settled in a reasonable, gentlemanly manner.
 </p>
    <p> The other type of conflict is emotional in nature and isn't grounded in anything significant. It's often triggered by clashing personalities and values, but is ultimately rooted in a childish, entitled disposition towards the world. People who have conquered real struggles in their lives and who are constantly pushing themselves to greater heights don't become caught up in petty bickering with others - they don't have time for it. </p>
    <p> When I find myself in the first type of conflict, I engage with it head-on and usually arrive at a satisfactory conclusion with the other party with no hard feelings. If someone tries to start the second type of conflict with me, I will deal with the other person in a polite manner but mentally downgrade them and avoid dealing with them in the future. </p>
