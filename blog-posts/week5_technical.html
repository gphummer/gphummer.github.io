  <h1 class="post_title"> When To Use Classes in Ruby </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> Oftentimes in the course of creating a program you will want to do more than merely re-use a single code function. Instead, you will want to extend the concept of code reusability to include pre-defined properties and functions which interact with each other in an appropriately scoped manner. This is more or less the essence of object-oriented programming. This leads to a commonly asked question: how do I create classes in Ruby?
 </p>
    <p> When you design a class, think about the objects that will be created from that class type. Think about the things the object knows and the things the object does. </p>

<p> Things an object knows about itself are called instance variables. They represent an object's state (the data - for example, the quantity and the product id), and can have unique values for each object of that type. </p>

<p> Things an object can do are called methods. </p>

    <p> Let's dive in and create a class of a car: </p>

    Class Car <br />
    def initialize(brand, model, year) <br />
    # Instance variables <br />
      @brand = brand <br />
      @model = model <br />
      @year = year <br />
    end <br /> <br />

    def drive <br />
      puts "I'm driving a #{@brand}!" <br />
    end <br /> <br />

    def honk <br />
      puts "Honk!" <br />
    end <br /> <br />
    end <br />

    <p> Now let's make an instance of the class: </p>

    my_prius = Car.new('Toyota', 'Prius', 2013) <br />

    <p> Now let's call the class's methods: </p>

    my_prius.drive <br />
    my_prius.honk <br />

    <p> And that's how you make a class and call it! Hope you learned something. </p>
