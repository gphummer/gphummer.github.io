  <div class="post_content">
    <p> JavaScript is oftentimes called the 'programming language of the web.' It allows you to modify what would normally be static elements on an HTML page and move them around, modify their values, add to them, delete them, animate them, and so on, all within the comfort of the client web browser. But there's one question people sometimes have: WHY? Why is JavaScript so popular?
 </p>
    <p>
      First of all, JavaScript is (relatively) easy to learn. It's a weakly typed language, meaning that beginners can make mistakes with object/variable data types and still have their programs run. This can actually be counterproductive since it introduces hard-to-track bugs, but it enables you to get up and running with JavaScript quickly. JavaScript also benefits from a network effect; that is, the more people that use it, the more libraries, frameworks and documentation are written for it, making it more valuable than other languages which might be superior but lack the extraordinary and huge community JavaScript has built over decades of being the web's programming language.

    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the biggest reason why JavaScript is so popular is because it's implemented in every web browser. Simply put, if you want to easily create client side/front-end code, as far as I can see JavaScript is your only real option.
