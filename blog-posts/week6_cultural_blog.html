  <h1 class="post_title"> Stereotype Threat </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> Stereotype threat is a major, serious issue affecting our youth. Stereotype threat is the threat of feeling stereotyped. Stereotype threat is bad and we should do everything in our power to stop it. Research shows that stereotype threat is an issue, not a myth, and so it's important that we combat it. As a heterosexual male I can't imagine what it's like to be stereotyped, but it probably feels bad. It's important that society looks past stereotypes into the heart of matters.
 </p>
    <p> Dictionary.com says a stereotype is, "A simplified and standardized conception or image invested with special meaning and held in common by members of a group: The cowboy and Indian are American stereotypes." It's bad to stereotype people and we shouldn't do it.  </p>
    <p> Another stereotype is the stereotype that certain member of certain groups malevolently apply stereotypes to others. It's important that we look out for that type of stereotyping as well, lest we go on witch hunts that are unfounded in reality. Ultimately, everybody should stop stereotyping since it's destructive to human relationships. </p>
