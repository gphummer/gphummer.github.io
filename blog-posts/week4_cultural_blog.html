    <p> One of the biggest problems the tech industry faces is the low bar it sets for itself with regards to the new technologies of the future. As Peter Thiel wrote in a manifesto a few years ago: "We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters." This isn't a denouncement of social media or consumer web apps, but rather, an expression of disappointment in the slowed rate of technological growth over the last few decades. This is a subtle argument and people often react emotionally and illogically when it's presented, but I believe it has a lot of evidence in its favor.
 </p>
    <p> It's almost inconceivable to think of the current US Government funding and successfully completing a project on the scale of an Apollo Mission, a Manhattan Project or the interstate highway system. Instead, it bickers about a few percentage points in the top marginal tax rate and whether to legalize marijuana. Similarly, US culture has shifted away from a determinate optimism about what the future is and how it will be built, along with a definite plan for building it, towards a vague notion that 'things will be better.' One marker for this is the decline in the popularity of science fiction novels. </p>

    <p> Essentially, the tech industry over the last decades has shifted from solving transformational problems to solving incremental ones. The future people envisioned in the 1960s is the future we're still waiting for today, and I blame it largely on falling standards and lowered expectations. Certainly, there are companies like Google which are making important strides in creating new technological paradigms (such as driverless cars) but in my opinion, that's not enough. Entrepreneurs need to stop making stupid photo sharing apps and start looking for ways to cure cancer, create artificial intelligence, make house cleaning robots, and all the other million ways peoples' lives can be genuinely improved. </p>
