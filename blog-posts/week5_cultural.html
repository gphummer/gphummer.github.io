  <h1 class="post_title"> Pairing and Giving Feedback </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> I've had a lot of fun pairing with people to solve different challenges. It can be difficult at times to coordinate meetings and deal with connection problems, but I haven't encountered any insurmountable technical/scheduling difficulties yet that have made working with another student impossible in my challenges so far. In particular though, the biggest distraction in most of my pairing sessions has been noise. A lot of people in my cohort seem to be in a limbo living situation until DBC really begins, and they therefore have to use public wifi in crowded, noisy areas. In spite of this, I've still had productive pairing sessions with everybody I've met so far.
 </p>
    <p> I've learned things during the pairing sessions that would have taken me much longer to learn on my own. In addition, having another person look at and analyse your code can't help bu make you a better programmer, as they can point out blind spots you might have in the way you create code.  </p>

    <p> I don't have any feedback on my feedback dashboard yet, so I can't comment on the issue of receiving anonymized feedback and what it's like. </p>
