    <p> Watching Shereef's fireside chat (is that an FDR reference?) gave me a lot more insight into DBC's culture. The first major topic Shereef touched on was the so-called restaurant/kitchen mindset dichotomy. In a restaurant mindset, a person feels entitled to receive a service in exchange for having paid money. In a kitchen mindset, a person loses their focus on being entitled to receive value and enters a 'creative' state of mind. This seems plausible to me; programming is fundamentally an act of intellectual creativity and expecting to receive a good or service is fundamentally at odds with the mindset a person is in when they're creating something.</p>
    <p> To be honest, I'm not sure if I will like what seems to be the extreme emphasis on the 'human/emotional' element of software development vs gaining the actual skillset of becoming a developer. I hope it doesn't comprise more than 25% of the DBC curriculum. Working with others is certainly important, but coming from a sales business background, I've always been able to work well with others in business settings. Additionally, the reason why I became interested in software development in the first place was the no-BS quality of its output and the logical effort/brainpower required to make a quality program; a product/application is either good or it isn't, and the code either works well or it doesn't work well. </p>
    <p> Overall, I'm excited to attend DBC and can't wait until Phase 1 begins. </p>

restaurant mindset: walk in, pay your money, what am i going to get out of this? feeling entitled because you paid for something.

kitchen mindset: 'we are all in this together'; you get out of consumer mode and into creator mode.

Obviously, kitchen mindset is superior.

Two fears students tend to have: a) fear of being inferior/imposter syndrome. b) fear that the curriculum is too slow/i won't learn enough.

Learning programming principles is more important than learning the specific languages. Architect building materials vs architecture principles analogy.
