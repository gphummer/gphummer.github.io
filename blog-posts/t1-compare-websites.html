  <h1 class="post_title"> Website Comparisons </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> The first website I analyzed was <a href="www.twitch.tv">twitch.tv</a>. Twitch is a livestream gaming site that was recently acquired by Amazon for $1 billion. Twitch's business model is to offer streamer-specific subscriptions to viewers which remove advertisements and give them custom emoticons and increased interaction with their favorite streamers. The streamers have a revenue-split agrement with the site. Popular streamers make well into 6-figure annual incomes and have tens of thousands of simultaneous viewers. Twitch also serves as a platform for multi-million dollar e-sports tournaments. </p>

    <p> When you first arrive on a Twitch page, your eyes are immediately drawn to the 'featured stream' at the center of the screen. If it's not to your liking, you can easily scroll down for more streams or hit the browse button in the header. Twitch's website effectively combines graphical and textual elements to guide the viewer towards the content they are most likely to find entertaining. Twitch's design can be characterized as being crowded, interactive, responsive, speedy and in a state of constant change. In summary, Twitch's combination of entertaining livestream content with a design to effectively deliver that content has propelled it to be worth a billion dollars in only a couple years of existence.</p>

    <p> The second website I analyzed was <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>. Hacker News began as a social news website catering to the alumni and employees of Y Combinator companies but has since branched out to include much of the software engineering community in general. On any given day I browse Hacker News I can see news stories and blog posts about the tech world that I'd probably never come across elsewhere and read the thoughts of commenters who possess an unparalleled level of technical knowledge. Hacker News has an intuitive, sparse, minimalist, text-based aesthetic, vaguely reminiscent of Craigslist in its simplicity.  </p>

    <p> Hacker News' content is primarily meant to inform and educate readers about the goings-on of the tech world. It also serves as a hiring platform for companies to acquire new talent and for developers to find work with both startups and established firms. There are also 'Ask HN' threads in which a poster asks the community for advice on a topic; oftentimes the questions are related to occupational issues, such as whether to take a new job, whether to part ways with a startup co-founder, how to negotiate with a venture capitalist, and so forth.
    </p>

    <p>The final website I analyzed was <a href="http://www.gmail.com">Gmail</a>, Google's web-based email service. Gmail has a simple, intuitive interface for reading and writing emails and its design scales well across a variety of devices. It loads quickly and is powered by Google's vast array of servers and engineers to ensure it has virtually no downtime. It's also free! Gmail makes money from scanning your emails for advertising keywords to target you with during your web browsing, so if privacy is a concern, Gmail is not a good email service to use. </p>
