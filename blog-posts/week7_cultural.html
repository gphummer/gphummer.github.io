  <h1 class="post_title"> Values </h1>
  <div class="post_content">
    <p> I find myself happiest when I'm exploring new avenues of thought and learning new ideas and ways of relating to reality. In fact,
      aside from the other obvious sources of contentment like friends, family members, and good food, learning new things is one of the only
      'sustainable highs' I've discovered in life. I'll refrain from trying to superimpose some cheesy list of corporate adjectives onto what I find truly satisfying, but learning is a huge one. </p>
    <p> Another big source of satisfaction for me is being surrounded by smart people who are truly open-minded (not the pseudo open-mindedness that is claimed by many academic institutions but is really used as a cover for ideological indoctrination) who are willing to consider any and all facets of existence, even if those ideas might make ordinary humans feel uncomfortable or even shocked. Essentially, I love being around people who have grown beyond what they wish the world could be like to ones who embrace the world as it is. Quite a rare breed, and I treasure them whenever I find them.</p>
    <p> Finally, I highly value independence. I despise being a cog in a hierarchy and if I ever find myself in that role for too long I experience a sense of gradually increasing chronic agitation until I remove myself from the situation. I believe agitation is a superior response to the other, far more terrible outcome that I've seen such cog-like jobs induce: The destruction of man's spirit.</p>
